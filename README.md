# CasinoGame
This is a fun game created using C++ where the player plays with the computer by guessing the same number as the computer. This is purely luck-based. 

When the program runs, it takes user's name and deposit amount to start the game. And then, it asks the user for the amount they want to bet and the number they bet on. If computer gives the same number that the user have bet on, they user gets 10 times the bet amount. Otherwise, loses the bet amount.

This game can be played till the user looses all the amount or until they wants to continue.
